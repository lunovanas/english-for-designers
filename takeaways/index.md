# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. First of all, I have __learned to write__ — to write clear and understandable texts. My readability score (in Hemingway) improved from 14 to 6!
2. I studied my way of thinking and the formation of thoughts — I found my style.
3. I found out about the _western approach_ to CV. It means more About Me information, trying to meet somebody as a person.
4. I got a lot of cool and useful links about typography, UX design, and checking grammar and readability levels. And also videos with communication advice.
5. Pay attention to the logic of the narrative, syllables, and the Oxford comma.
