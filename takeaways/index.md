# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. First of all, I have __learned to write__. To write clear and understandable texts. My Hemingway score improved from 14 to 6 in regular texts!
2. I studied my way of thinking and the formulation of thoughts - I found my style.
3. I found out about the "western approach" to CV. It means more about-me information, trying to meet smbd as a person.
4. I got a lot of cool and useful links about typography, UX design, and checking grammar and readability levels. And also videos with communication advice.
5. Pay attention to the logic of the narrative, syllables, and the Oxford comma.
