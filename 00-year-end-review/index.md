# Year End Review

## 1) What did you like most about this course?
This course was special because of its super friendly and supportive atmosphere. There always was an individual approach and no pressure. I also appreciate that there was a focus on developing skills that will go with students outside the school (communication and presentation skills, compiling interesting texts). 

## 2) What did you like least about this course?
Oh, maybe it's the need to duplicate presentations in Github. I like the system you've built here and it's very handy for navigating and finding interesting stuff. It's just that sometimes it's hard for me, because I'm lazybones.

## 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?
* Mind Maps are really helpful. 
* The algorithm of keeping creativity mode on. 
* Writing texts is the design too. 
* Importance of alternative texts for inclusivity.
* Hemingway.

_Sorry, I have the Top-5 :)_

## 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?
One of the most memorable assignments was writing text for a presentation using mind maps. I was surprised at how interesting and unexpected the results were. I have used this tool before, but not while preparing for presentations. Also, I remember being impressed by a challenge when we were explaining to another team how to draw a picture with just a written instruction. It would seem that everything is simple and clear, but it turned out to be a non-trivial challenge :) 

## 5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?
Storytelling — is a presentation where I reviewed my experience up to this point and it helped me gain confidence. As a person prone to introspection, I was pleased to complete this task. Also it helped me to accept the fact that even if my path differs from the ideal, this is still interesting experience. After all, "this is not a bug, this is a feature". 

## 6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?
Well, here it is: this is not a bug, this is a feature :))
But seriously, I realized that all my cases (except for school ones) are about cosmetics. Maybe I should try something else. Or continue to develop my skills in this area, I have not yet decided.

## 7) What’s one thing you could have done better?
This semester, I should have been better at keeping track of time and deadlines.

## 8) What’s one thing I could have done better?
Maybe to be a little bit stricter with deadlines... to keep us in shape:) Actually, everything was awesome. Thank you all for the advice, support, cool topics, interesting video and discussions after!

## 9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?
I spent a lot of time thinking about this question, and I still don't know what to suggest. I had everything and in the right amount: speaking, discussions, interesting articles and videos, inspiration from others, and not much teamwork.

## 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?
Relax and don't be afraid to be yourself. Justin has a unique ability to understand and open the strengths of those around him. I believe it's because he accepts others as they are. So don't worry about how you appear with imperfect English - it's okay, and everyone knows that. Keep trying, keep working, and be sure that you'll find a friendly community here.
