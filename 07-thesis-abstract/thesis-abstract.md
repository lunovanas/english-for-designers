# Cosmetic brand visual identity

by Anastasiia Lunova

## Abstract

The Bachelor's thesis describes the development of the visual identity and commu-nication style of a new cosmetic brand. This brand will be a subsidiary brand of an already established company in the Czech Republic, which specializes in the produ-ction and distribution of premium professional nail cosmetics. With a forecast of customer attrition due to the current economic situation, the company aims to offer a more affordable alternative. However, it also wants to maintain the reputation and quality of its products. The aim of the thesis is to create a solution for the new brand within the architecture of an Endorsed Brand. This means that although the newly emerging brand may have its own identity, it can also leverage the good name of the parent brand.

The theoretical part of the thesis focuses on analyzing the main brand and resear-ching the competitive environment. The practical part includes creating a logo, visual style, Tone of Voice, packaging, and examples of digital communication. Introducing the new brand to the market offers the company an opportunity to expand its custo-mer portfolio and withstand turbulent times.
