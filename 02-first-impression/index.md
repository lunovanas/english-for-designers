# First Impression

## Hi, I′m Anastasiia!
My feature is to give you a living brand, not just a logo.

In my work, I like to combine design, marketing, psychology and neuroscience. Each brand is a living entity, with its own character, features, voice, and behavior.
I think this approach is also connected with my love for fantasy and fictional worlds, science fiction, and cinema.
