## Who am I

## My Story

Hi, nice to meet you!
I′m currently based in Prague, Czech Republic, but originally from brave Ukraine ✌

In my work I like to combine design, marketing, and psychology. Each brand is a living entity for me, with its own character, features, voice, and behavior. 
My experience: Human-Computer Interaction course, 4 years in marketing, Graphic Design student.
Also, I'm a gamer...board games gamer :) Apart from my work and study, I enjoy traveling, dancing, and reading.
