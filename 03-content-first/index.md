[__who:__] Hello! I'm Anastasiia, a brand designer. Nice to meet you!

[__where:__] Currently based in Prague, Czech Republic, but originally from brave Ukraine ✌

[__work:__] My work is a combination of design, marketing, psychology, and neuroscience. Each brand is a living entity for me, with its own character, features, voice, and behavior. 

 [__experience:__] Human-Computer Interaction course, 4 years in marketing, student majoring in Graphic Design.

[__also:__] Also, I'm a gamer...board games gamer 😊 Apart from my work and study, I enjoy traveling, dancing, reading and, it seems, figure skating (but so far I have only skated twice 😏)
