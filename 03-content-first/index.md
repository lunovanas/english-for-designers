Hello! I'm Anastasiia, a brand designer. Nice to meet you!

I'm currently based in Prague, Czech Republic, but I'm originally from brave Ukraine.

In my work, I like to combine design, marketing, psychology, and neuroscience. Each brand is a living entity for me, with its own character, features, voice, and behavior.
I think this approach is also connected with my love for fantasy and fictional worlds, science fiction, cinema.

My previous HCI studying and four years of experience in marketing help me to take a wider view of my work and inspire me when I am looking for a way to solve a project.

Also, I'm a gamer...board games gamer :) Apart from my work and study, I enjoy traveling, dancing, reading and, it seems, figure skating (but so far I have only skated twice) :)
