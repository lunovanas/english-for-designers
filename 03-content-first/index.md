[__who:__] Hello! I'm Anastasiia, a brand designer. Nice to meet you!

[__where:__] I'm currently based in Prague, Czech Republic, but I'm originally from brave Ukraine ‚úå

[__work:__] My work is combination of design, marketing, psychology, and neuroscience. Each brand is a living entity for me, with its own character, features, voice, and behavior. The previous studying of Human-Computer Interaction and four years of experience in marketing help me to take a wider view of my work and inspire me when I am looking for a way to solve a project.

[__also:__] Also, I'm a gamer...board games gamer :) Apart from my work and study, I enjoy traveling, dancing, reading and, it seems, figure skating (but so far I have only skated twice üòè)
