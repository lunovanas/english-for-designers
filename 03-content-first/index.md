[__work:__] In my work I like to combine design, marketing, and psychology. Each brand is a living entity for me, with its own character, features, voice, and behavior. 

 [__experience:__] Human-Computer Interaction course, 4 years in marketing, Graphic Design student.

[__also:__] Also, I'm a gamer...board games gamer 😊 Apart from my work and study, I enjoy traveling, dancing, reading and, it seems, figure skating (but so far I have only skated twice 😏)
