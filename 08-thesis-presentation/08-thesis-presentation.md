## The Background of the Topic

**The Topic:** creating a brand of gel polishes, which will fulfil the role of an Endorsed Brand of an already existing premium brand.

**The Motive:** the forecast of the company's analysts regarding the customer churn. 
The current brand cooperates with category A salons and is located in a higher price category on the market. The company's response to the current economic situation and world trends is the decision to offer a more affordable alternative.
1) maintaining the reputation of the brand and the quality of the products;
2) the possibility of focusing on a wider target group (salons of category B and B+);
3) the possibility of gradual transition of new customers to the main brand in the future.

*The Aim:* creating a visual identity and communication style of the new brand.

## Main Brand Analysis

The EMI logo consists of three letters written in contrasting serif font, featuring a modern and minimalist design with clear lines and shapes for enhanced readability and easy zooming.
The chosen fonts for EMI present a limitation as they are not suitable for languages with diacritics, disregarding the international representation of the company. The bottle layout incorporates sharp shapes and wide lines, creating a unique visual style while maintaining some resemblance to the parent brand, allowing for necessary brand connection without direct copying.
EMI's brand positioning focuses on design and fashion, offering trendy gel nail shades, special decorations, and nail art techniques, while maintaining a reputation for excellence and high-quality products in the professional nail cosmetics industry.
