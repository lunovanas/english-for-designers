## The Background of the Topic

**The Topic:** creating a brand of gel polishes, which will fulfil the role of an Endorsed Brand of an already existing premium brand.

**The Motive:** the forecast of the company's analysts regarding the customer churn. 
The current brand cooperates with category A salons and is located in a higher price category on the market. The company's response to the current economic situation and world trends is the decision to offer a more affordable alternative.
1) maintaining the reputation of the brand and the quality of the products;
2) the possibility of focusing on a wider target group (salons of category B and B+);
3) the possibility of gradual transition of new customers to the main brand in the future.

*The Aim:* creating a visual identity and communication style of the new brand.
