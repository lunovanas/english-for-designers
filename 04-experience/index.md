## Experience

**Freelance Graphic Designer**

2021 | present

I got into graphic design because of an interesting turn of events. There was a period when the he company where I work tried to hire a designer, but without success. No matter what, the workflow must continue – marketing always needs mockups, ads, and so on. We had some materials in other languages, so I just began to edit the layouts. Next, I needed more serious skills and requested a training course from the company. I realized that this is what I really wanted to do since childhood. So, I decided to get a second education in this field and combine it with practice.
Now, my specialization is a brand identity and visual communication. My experience in a marketing helps me to understand the market and create brands that will work.
Here are my cases:
- rebrand of CineStar cinema chain;
- gel polish brand Grey Owl;
- gel polish line Salon Effect;
- care cosmetics brand Beyond.
